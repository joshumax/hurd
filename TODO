-*- Mode: Outline -*-

Before working on anything in this file, it's very important that you
make contact with the core Hurd developers.  Things herein might be
slightly out of date or otherwise not easy to understand at first
glance.  So write to <bug-hurd@gnu.org> first.

Priorities:
  Check the end of this file for a task list referring to the next
  public release.

  Reported bugs generally have top priority.
  Non-reported and non-encountered bugs (things we know don't work,
    but don't really impede things) have lower priority.
  Things in this file are ranked with one to three !; the more, the
  higher priority.

See `tasks', the exported task list.

* Contents of =pending-changes.
* Make sure all the pieces of the Hurd have adequate version stuff. !
* fix root dependencies in filesystem, network, etc. !
* Profile things !!
* Write coding standards suggestions for Hurd
* Implement file_fetch_dir
* Conform to coding standards (esp. CFLAGS setting)
* Internationalization !
* Use hostid in /etc/rc and mention it in installation instructions,
  when suitable sh-utils is released.
* "user-friendly" naming scheme for /dev

* Fix emacs/src/unexelf.c to deal with occasional lack of mmap !

* Currently libshouldbeinlibc (idvec, etc) and password.defs and login
  all think there is one user per-uid, and that ain't necessarily so.
  Needs fixed.  !

* Libraries

** general:
*** implement all the pathconf things from Posix.1 right.
*** implement an soversion and symbol-versioning scheme similar to libc's.

** libc:
*** !!!! Do these for libc 2.3 (ask Roland for details):
**** nix hurdmalloc, use special arena with new _int_malloc
**** TLS support
**** avoid sbrk altogether in malloc (don't link it in at all for static)?
**** maybe hack libio to use _hurd_fd_read et al directly as stdio used to
*** (once vm_remap exists) implement mremap
*** when a session leader _exits, it should SIGHUP, TIOCDRAIN, and revoke. !!!
    [it is still under discussion exactly where to address this,
     so don't do it in libc yet]
*** Version of tmpfile that takes a directory
*** flink
*** make sure profiling works !!
*** many functions that are syscalls in unix can potentially leak send rights
    if a signal handler longjmp's out past them.  They should probably all
    be using HURD_CRITICAL_SECTION to avoid this. !!
** items relocated from libc/hurd/STATUS:
*** We are not sure about possible races between setpgrp (A, pgrp) from
    process B vs process A receiving proc_newids.
*** does sigaltstack/sigstack really work? -- NO
*** hurdmalloc kludge
*** think more about environment variable use viz security
*** SIGINFO handler?
*** itimers could be implemented better
*** mmap cannot do MAP_NOEXTEND.
*** unimplemented calls(?)
    acct
    getfh
    getfsstat
    madvise
    mincore
    mount
    msync
    sstk
    swapon
    unmount


** libports:
*** Get rid of general `uninibited-rpcs' mechanism in libports, & just
    special-case interrupt_operation. !

** libstore:
*** Add lock protocol for mutable stores.
*** Creating/opening stores with STORE_INACTIVE should work (and then the hack
    in storeio/dev.c should be removed).

** libfsserver/libnetfs:
*** convert libnetfs to libfsserver

** libnetfs
*** Support --readonly, --writable, and --update !
*** Implement dir_reparent.

** libpager:
*** Put user-defined fns into a callback struct passed to pager_create. !
*** Make libpager paging interface able to read/write multiple pages at once.
*** flush functions don't actually force pending delayed copies. (and in
    fact, they seem to block if a delayed copy is wired down) !

** libshouldbeinlibc:
*** Merge contents of libshouldbeinlibc that belong there into libc.
   Rename the rest to libhurdutil or somesuch.

** libdiskfs
*** Add the short-circuited-but-not-builtin translator startup code from
    dir-lookup to fsys_getroot.  Compare and match carefully these two
    routines and then share common code.
*** Implement Posix O_SYNC, O_DSYNC, and O_RSYNC under the right
    names; change libc header to match current Posix.
*** Handle dead name notifications on execserver ports. !
*** Deal correctly with setting the translators on /servers/exec.
*** Implement file_notice_changes.
*** Implement async I/O. !
*** Think of a way to have when-to-sync-nodes be more flexible so it can
    be done right for each format.
*** Provide for MNT_NODEV, etc. !
*** Implement io_restrict_auth correctly. !
*** Use off_t correctly. !!
*** Add a consistent message printing facility for filesystems to use
    (syslog, but takes special care when the root file system?). !!
*** Some of diskfs_readonly_changed in ext2fs should be in generic
    routines. !

** libfshelp
*** Put functions here to deal with directory and file change notifications !!!
*** Translator startup should provide a more useful stdin/stdout than nothing !

** libtrivfs
*** Allow for read/write/exec to be passed down.
*** Implement file_exec_paths when appropriate. !!
*** Provide for the visible owner, etc., to be held in command-line args
    instead of the underlying node, when it's important. !!

** libps
*** Add option to print values times with a delay,
    and to print values relative to last printing.
*** Whizzier columnation (autosizing?)
*** Make getters more robust.

* Servers
** finish default pager in defpager !!
** Implement goaway in all the servers that don't already have it. !!
** (init) sleep on spinning gettys !
** Add calls to various servers to return interesting statistical information.
** Test new-fifo & make it fifo. !
** Login/utmp?
** fifos are flaky.  ?? Details ??
** implement io_revoke for things in trans/ that need it. !

** pflocal
*** make peer addresses work?
*** implement io_revoke on sockets !

** term:
*** find a way to reduce duplicate signals from repeated VINTR input
*** when a session leader exits, netbsd SIGHUP's the terminal, drains output,
    and then revokes it.  (See Posix.1-1996, p. 184, l. 64-68.)
*** when a session leader sets the ospeed to 0, netbsd SIGHUP's the termianl.
*** enforce session leader / controlling terminal uniqueness rules. !
    (1: if a terminal is matched to a session, then another session
        can't make it its controlling terminal;
     2: tcsetpgrp to a pgrp that's not in the right sessions must
        fail;
     3: when a session leader exits, the association has to be torn
        down; bsd does SIGHUP + drain + revoke.)

** proc:
*** Add a version of proc_wait usable by non-parent processes, and use it in
    gdb; maybe just a flag WNOREAP to proc_wait that doesn't reap and allows
   anyone to use it.  !!
*** Add proc_get_tty() [returns tty opened with no flags], so that ps can be
    non-suid. !
*** add timeouts to all the msg_* calls proc makes. !

** pfinet
*** Allow multiple pfinets to arp on the same ethernet interface for different
    IP addresses. !!
*** Diagnose why shutdown doesn't close TCP channels properly or reliably. !
*** select for read on a UDP socket seems never to return. !!!
*** Undefined functions at the end of pfinet/io-ops.c. !!
*** Implement io_revoke on sockets. !
*** Implement SO_LINGER correctly (close() should return EWOULDBLOCK if not all
    packets could be delivered). !

** nfs
*** Implement async I/O !!
*** Finish work to turn on paging. !!
*** Implement TCP nfs. !
*** Implement V3 nfs.
*** Implement nqnfs. !
*** Add Hurd-specific calls. !!
*** errors in mount_root should get reflected more usefully to users. !

** storeio:
*** Make a server (/servers/storeio?) to share multiple storeio nodes
*** Serverify, ala new-fifo.
*** implement io_revoke !

** ext2fs
*** Try to write directories with 512-byte record boundaries. !!
*** Maybe file_pager_write_page should be able to accurately reproduce holes
*** Add byte-swapping. !!
*** If the target of a symlink is the empty string, stat seems to spin forever !!!

** arla -- port it


* Utilities
** Make id, et. al. work with no/multiple uids. !!!
** Make things work with the `nobody' mode bits: chmod, ls, ... !
** Make things work with filesystem extensions (author, etc.): ls!!!
** Make things work better with translators, e.g., tar... !!!
** Fix bash to turn on interrupts around syscalls more generally,
    especially chdir. !!
** talk doesn't work !!
** login: Make --retry work correctly when invoked via a suid shell
    script by other than root (it doesn't now if the script specifies
    --retry="$0" because the exec server will use /dev/fd/N for name,
    and child_lookup() doesn't supply more than fds 0-2). !!
** Make w use utmp's tty instead of the process's

** fsck:
*** fsck should use fsys_get_options returned device instead of /etc/fstab !!

** settrans:
*** needs an option to make the active go away without using goaway. !

** ps:
*** ps should timeout quickly (one second?) on non-responsive message ports. !
*** help displays for: stat letters, format specs.
*** --match option?
*** fetch and print task (and thread?) startup times.

** gdb:
*** Add various mach convenience features (vminfo, &c). !!
*** Be even more vigilant about noticing new threads.  In particular:
**** For mach-indep thread commands, before validating against
     internal thread list. !!!
*** read core files !!
*** Gdb doesn't work right if it doesn't have permission to frob the
    inferior process (for instance, if it's a set[ug]id program), but
    doesn't give a meaningful error message.  Try `break main' in /bin/login.

** nfsd
*** Implement TCP nfs. !
*** Implement V3 nfs. !
*** Implement nqnfs. !
*** Add Hurd-specific calls. !!
*** writes don't seem to work properly !!!
*** Report statfs correctly. !!

* Mach:
** Have the at-close actions on devices be more directly controllable
   by users by deleting the current at-close actions and replacing
   them with suitable device_set_status calls.
** Specify and implement vm_remap.

???
  [I'm not sure of the preconditions for this; it usually seems to happen to
   new login shells (but not often enough to really get a handle on it).
   If the command is repeated, then it usually works correctly.]
  login> ps aux|head
  bash: /bin/head: (ipc/send) invalid msg-header
  Broken pipe
  [bash only seems to print error messages in this particular format if an
   execve fails]

  I've also had it happen in shells that have been around a while.  -thomas

  I just saw it happen in make output; there the particular error
  happens only when execvp fails.  -thomas
