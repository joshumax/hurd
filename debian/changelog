  * New snapshot from CVS, containing lots of small bug fixes, and:
    + Together with gnumach 1.2-9, you can access large stores with
    storeinfo, storeread (because libstore uses the new interface in
    gnumach, and off64_t internally).
    + pfinet contains support for network ioctls. The corresponding
    changes in the glibc library are not available in Debian yet, though.
  * streamdev is renamed to streamio.
