	* loop.c (server_loop): Use memset instead bzero.
	(server_loop): Add parenthesis for post-decrement (even
	though it is only used as an lvalue here).  Increment P after
	using it in the macro, not within.
	* ops.c (complete_setattr): Likewise.
	(op_setattr, op_read, op_write, op_create, op_symlink, op_mkdir,
	op_readdir, op_getport): Likewise.
	* xdr.c (encode_fattr): Likewise.
	(encode_data): Likewise.  Also use memcpy instead bcopy.
	(encode_statfs): Likewise.
	(decode_name): Likewise.  Also use memcpy instead bcopy.
	(encode_fhandle): Use memcpy instead bcopy.
	* cache.c (process_cred): Add parenthesis for post-decrement (even
	though it is only used as an lvalue here).  Increment P after
	using it in the macro, not within.
	(idspec_lookup): Use memcpy, not bcopy.
	(lookup_cache_handle): Likewise.
	(create_cached_handle): Likewise.
	(check_cached_replies): Likewise.

2002-05-29  Roland McGrath  <roland@frob.com>

2002-05-08  Roland McGrath  <roland@frob.com>

	* main.c (main): Cast int to intptr_t before any_t.

2002-05-07  Roland McGrath  <roland@frob.com>

	* loop.c (server_loop): size_t -> socklen_t

	* fsys.c: Likewise.

2002-03-23  James A. Morrison  <ja2morri@uwaterloo.ca>

	* fsys.c (init_filesystems): Use error, not fprintf.  Use
	MACH_PORT_NULL explicitly.

2000-12-02  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	* ops.c (op_readlink): Before returning, check if the buffer
	pointed to by transp is ours. If not, munmap it.
	(op_read): Likewise for bp.
	(op_readdir): Don't alloca a buffer here. Instead initialize
	BUF and BUFSIZE to 0 and let the server (eh, MiG) do it.
	munmap BUF before returning.

2000-12-01  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	* cache.c (scan_creds): Move I inside for-statement.
	Replace inner for-loop with a while-loop. New variable
	NEXT_I set to I->NEXT, because we might free I.
	Set I to NEXT_I at end of while block.
	Move update of leastidlastuse inside if block, because
	otherwise we will constantly prevent ourself from scanning.
	(scan_fhs): Very much the same.
	(scan_replies): Likewise. Also free CR.

	(check_cached_reply): Make HASH value absolute (as XID can be
	negative, and thus the modulus).
	Initialize REFERENCES to 1.

Tue Aug 13 14:38:36 1996  Thomas Bushnell, n/BSG  <thomas@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ops.c (op_create): Sun's NFS client implementation actually
 	bombs if do do what RFC 1094 says to do in section 2.2.10.  So
 	don't pass O_EXCL, but do pass O_TRUNC.  That's what NetBSD does.

	* ops.c (op_setattr): Fill in an fattr in reply.

Mon Aug 12 11:15:15 1996  Thomas Bushnell, n/BSG  <thomas@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* main.c (index_file): New var.
	(index_file_name): Initialize from index_file.
	(main): Don't initialize index_file_name here.

	* ops.c (op_null, op_getattr, op_setattr, op_lookup, op_readlink,

	correct slot.
	(init_filesystems): When allocating or reallocating FSYSTABLE,
	make sure the new entries are zeroed.
	(enter_filesystem): Likewise.

Tue Aug  6 13:18:40 1996  Thomas Bushnell, n/BSG  <thomas@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* cache.c (create_cached_handle): Always call fsys_getfile when
	creating a new cached handle instead of relying upon the passed in
	port.

	* xdr.c (hurd_mode_to_nfs_mode): Specify octal number in octal
	notation.
	(encode_fattr): Bother filling in all the fields.
