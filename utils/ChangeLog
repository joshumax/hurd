	* su.c (main): Getopt now returns '\001' for non-switch options

	* su.c (apply_auth): Use msg_add_auth & msg_del_auth instead of
	add_auth & del_auth.
	(apply_auth_to_pids, apply_auth_to_loginid, apply_auth_to_pgrp):
	Don't use the IDS variable, it's no longer around; I think AUTH is
	the right thing to replace it with.

Tue Apr  4 01:47:57 1995  Roland McGrath  <roland@churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ps.c (main): Treat argument without leading - as if it had one,
